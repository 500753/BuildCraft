Changes:

* Limited the maximum number of items that the guide book indexes to 10000 by default (configurable down to 5k, and up to 5m).
    If there are more items registered than this limit then only the important items will be indexed (so ones from minecraft
    or buildcraft or any mod that adds guide book entries).
* [#4505] Made the stirling engine gui always show the last dregs of fuel.

Bug Fixes:

* Fixed log spam when right-clicking a nearly-full tank with a bucket of fluid.
* [#3914] Fixed the redstone engine not heating up properly.
