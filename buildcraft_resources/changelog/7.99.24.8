Bug Fixes:

* Fix the heat exchanger passing a null fluid when auto-outputting an empty tank.
* Fix kinesis pipes never configuring on the client, which cause client-side engine rotation to not work correctly.
* [#4385] Fixed the autoworkbench duping leftover tools.

Changes:

* Added oil generation debug logging:
    * Enable some logging by adding "-Dbuildcraft.energy.oilgen.debug=log" to your launch arguments.
    * Enable all logging (very spammy) by adding "-Dbuildcraft.energy.oilgen.debug=true" instead of the above to your launch arguments.
* Updated Chinese translation. (SampsonnZ)
